## MESSAGEix-Pakistan

MESSAGEix-Pakistan directory contains the input excel workbooks, the scenario notebooks, and the reporting files. The `data/legacy/` and `report/legacy/` directories are inherited from the MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM ENGAGE reporting routines and adapted for the Pakistan node. Reporting is invoked from `report/legacy/iamc_report_hackathon.py`. Four scenarios are developed: Current Measures (CM), NDC-Unconditional (NDC-U), NDC-Conditional (NDC-C), and Net Zero (NZ). Each is solved through GAMS, and reported in an IAMC format by a dedicated notebook.

### Prerequisites

This is not a self-contained Python package; reproducing requires the full MESSAGEix toolchain:

- **GAMS** with a valid academic licence. The `scenario.solve()` step calls the GAMS backend. We used version 40.
- **`message_ix` and `ixmp`** version 3.9.0 were used.
- **Python** version 3.12.7 was used.

GAMS must be installed separately. Please consult https://docs.messageix.org/en/latest/install.html for the complete MESSAGEix installation guide. The Python dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Scenarios

| Scenario | Notebook | Scenario name (`ixmp`) | Input workbook | Emission treatment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Current Measures | `current_measures.ipynb` | `current-measures` | `MESSAGEix-Pakistan-CurrentMeasures-SSP2.xlsx` | none (baseline) |
| NDC-Unconditional | `ndc-u.ipynb` | `ndc-u` | `MESSAGEix-Pakistan-NDC-U-SSP2.xlsx` | emission bounds from `emissionAllocation.xlsx` |
| NDC-Conditional | `ndc-c.ipynb` | `ndc-c` | `MESSAGEix-Pakistan-NDC-C_NZ-SSP2.xlsx` | emission bounds from `emissionAllocation.xlsx` |
| Net Zero | `net-zero.ipynb` | `net-zero` | `MESSAGEix-Pakistan-NDC-C_NZ-SSP2.xlsx` | emission bounds from `net_zero_emissions()`|

### Provenance and attribution

MESSAGEix-Pakistan is built on the `message_ix` and `ixmp` framework developed by IIASA. Please cite `message_ix` (Huppmann et al., 2019, *Environmental Modelling & Software*) and acknowledge GAMS alongside any use of this repository.
